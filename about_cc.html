				<p>Inspired by the scenes and scenery
			near our homes in Brooklyn and Manhattan, we
			founded <em>Curatted Commons</em> in order to
			capture and present the art of the instant,
			created by the circumstances of the commons,
			continuously blinking in and out of
			existence. We have had no hand in creating the
			artifacts collected in this gallery--we are
			merely curators and collectors.</p>
			         
			         <p>As art historians of the infintessimaly narrow
			frontier between present and past, we choose
			to remain in the back room of the gallery,
			letting the pieces speak for themselves in the front. </p>

			  <p>Pieces displayed in
			the Gallery are catalogued as they are
			collected.
			  </p>
			  <p>The artifacts evident in the pieces we
			exhibit are issued a physical catalogue card at the time
			that we enter the piece into the Gallery:
			immediately after the piece is created and
			then annihilated.
			  </p>
			  <p>Enjoy.
