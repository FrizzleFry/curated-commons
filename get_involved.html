			part of our collection, we would like to hear
			your voice.</p>

			<h3>Get curated</h3>
			<p>Chance and whim decides who we curate,
			photograph, label, and enter
			into our collection. If you were curated
			recently, please go here. We want to give
			art a voice. If you were not yet curated - but you would like
			to - check our movements on twitter. Chance may
			need a helping hand. </p>

			<h3>Get in touch</h3>
			<p> <a target=n href="http://www.twitter.com/curatedcommons"><span class="inline_head">Tweet </span></a>
			about Curated Commons. Let us and everyone
			know your thoughts. Join our twitter feed to
			learn where and when we calatogue. Visit our <span
			class="inline_head"> <a target=n
			href="https://www.facebook.com/curatedcommons">
			Facebook </a> </span> page. If you are not on
			twitter, check us out on Facebook to learn where we curate. Leave a

			<h3>Be kind to the art </h3>
			<p>Art is fragile and in need of
			protection. Harsh words may cause harm
			and are not the purpose of this
			project.
